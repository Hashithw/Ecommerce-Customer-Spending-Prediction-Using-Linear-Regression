# Ecommerce Customer Spending Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project applies linear regression to predict the yearly spending of ecommerce customers based on multiple factors such as Length of Membership, Time on App, and Time on Website. By analyzing the relationship between these features and the target variable, the model provides insights into which factors influence customer spending. The goal is to predict future customer behavior, helping businesses optimize their strategies for customer engagement and revenue growth.

## Methods
- Data Exploration: We start by exploring the dataset using visualizations to understand how different features relate to each other and to the target variable, Yearly Amount Spent.

- Feature Selection: The model uses key features like Avg. Session Length, Time on App, Time on Website, and Length of Membership to predict customer spending.

- Model Training: A linear regression model is trained on the training dataset to establish relationships between the features and the target variable.

- Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which measure the accuracy of the predictions.
